## Articles Headlines App
Create a proof of concept for an App that displays trend articles and allows the user to save the news for reading later.

## Requirements
- App to be built with a tab bar main navigation containing 3 tabs: **Headlines, Sources, Saved.**
- **Headlines**: screen to display a list of headlines based on the user-selected sources, each row should display (title, description, author, and thumbnail picture)
  - Tapping on a row should open the headline URL to read the full article within the app.
  - When viewing an article the user should be able to save it for reading later.
- **Sources**: screen to display the list of available sources for articles, the user should be able to select multiple sources and the selection should persist user sessions.
- **Saved**: screen to display a list of previously saved headlines, tapping a row should open the article for reading, the same way as the Headlines screen.
- User should be able to delete previously saved articles
- Previously saved articles should persist app launches
- Integrate the app with [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) API to fetch data (register to get your API Key)  

## Key points under evaluation
- Design and implement an app that can achieve all of the goals described above
- Highly modular
- Use of modern Swift syntax
- Good use of MVC, MVVM preferable
- Reuse of components
- Simple and concise code and project structure
- Clarity over brevity
- It is expected from the App to offer a good UX
- Programmatic UI
- RxSwift would be a big bonus
- Unit testing, provide coverage of important areas in the code

## Points of consideration
- Pagination is not required, API will return only the latest 10 articles per source
- Documentation for the API [https://newsapi.org/#documentation](https://newsapi.org/#documentation)
- Filter sources to be only for the English language
- A note on the usage of certain Libraries, you can use libraries you would normally use in a real project, however, use good judgment when deciding which ones, for example, using a NewsAPI client is not acceptable

## Allocated time
- Please provide submission no more than 3 days after received.
- Submissions will only be accepted via GitHub.
